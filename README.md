## DISCLAIMER
***NOTE: This project is a work in progress. Some features have not been implemented just yet and there could be issues/bugs that you might encounter. If you do please follow [this](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/TelltaleModLauncher/wiki/%5BHelp%5D---Reporting-an-Issue-or-Bug) to submit an issue.***

***NOTE (3/16/21): Creator functionality is being stripped and moved to the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor) as of the next release V0.7.0 which will be coming soon [(biggest update yet)](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/TelltaleModLauncher/blob/main/changes.txt).***

***NOTE (9/6/21): Apologies for the very very late update. I cannot predict when V0.7.0 will finally come but in the meantime I've updated the launcher to 0.6.5 which is mostly a quality-of-life update which makes the setup of the Launcher alot more simpler and less confusing (despite making a tutorial that is linked on this page that guides you how to set it up properly...)***

## Supported Games
The launcher currently supports the following games.
- **The Walking Dead Definitive Edition**

NOTE: The installer has not been tested with any other Telltale game besides 'The Walking Dead Definitive Edition' though future support is planned.
