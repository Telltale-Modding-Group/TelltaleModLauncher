# Telltale Mod Launcher

**NOTE: This project is still heavily a work in progress. Many critical features have not been implemented just yet and there will be issues/bugs that you will encounter.**

If you wish to try it out, you'll need Visual Studio to open the project and build it (Haven't put out a build just yet). If you encounter any bugs/issues or have suggestions, feel free to leave an 'issue' on the repository.

## About
This launcher is designed to make installing and managing mods for Telltale Games much easier through a launcher interface. In addition to that, the launcher also includes a hub for mod tools necessary for you to create a mod for a Telltale Title. You will be able to make the following mods.
- Texture Mods (not implemented yet)
- Sound Mods (not implemented yet)
- Scripting Mods (work in progress)

Scripting mods are currently possible using the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor), however the other two are currently a work in progress.
