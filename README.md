## About
This launcher is designed to make installing and managing mods for Telltale Games much easier through a very user friendly interface. In addition to that, the launcher also includes a hub for mod tools necessary for you to create a mod for a Telltale Title. You will be able to make the following mods.
- **Texture Mods** (not implemented yet)
- **[Sound Mods](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/SoundModCreator)** (work in progress, not implemented yet)
- **[Scripting Mods](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor)** (work in progress, not implemented yet)

Scripting mods are currently possible using the [Telltale Script Editor](https://github.com/Telltale-Modding-Group/Telltale-Script-Editor), however the other two are currently a work in progress.
