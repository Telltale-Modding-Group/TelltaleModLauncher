- [Added] Mod list refresh button, it's also automated as well in the background.
- [Added] Mod refresh to the context menu
- [Added] Mods (if supported) can now place files in the game directory automatically (useful since some mods will have .ini config files)
- [Added] Mod priorities are now displayed and visible, mod priorities can also be set and modified
- [Changed] Mods are now sorted by priority
- [Changed] Can still add/replace a mod even if it has both the same name and version (will give you a prompt instead of not allowing you to do it)
- [Removed] ttarchexe depedency, which has now been replaced by LibTelltale (By Lucas Saragosa).
- [Fix] Fixed issue when the launcher would crash when opening mod files that were not properly structured. (i.e. if you downloaded the source code zip of a project rather than the actual mod zip). Now it warns the user and displays an error
- [Fix] Fixed issue when the launcher would crash on startup due to the file system watcher for mod refreshing
