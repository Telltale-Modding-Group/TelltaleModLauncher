v0.7.0
- [Removed] Creator Tab since it's no longer needed. This functionality is moved seperately to the Telltale Script Editor
- [Removed] Game Mods Folder since it isn't necessary for the user to select, the launcher now automatically finds the correct folder for the game. Also causes less confusion during setup.
- [Removed] Removed the dependencies tab and options since most are not needed, and other depedencies are handled internally. No setup needed for the user.
- [Removed] Lua Compiler dependency since it's not needed
- [Removed] Lua Decompiler depedency since it's not needed 
- [Removed] ttarchexe depedency, which has now been replaced by LibTelltale (By Lucas Saragosa).
- [Added] Mod list refresh button, it's also automated as well in the background.
- [Added] Mod refresh to the context menu
- [Added] Mods (if supported) can now place files in the game directory automatically (useful since some mods will have .ini config files)
- [Added] Mod priorities are now displayed and visible, they can be set and modified
- [Changed] Mods are now sorted by priority
- [Changed] Can still add/replace a mod even if it has both the same name and version (will give you a prompt)
- [Fix] Fixed issue when launcher would crash when opening mod files that were not properly structured. (i.e. if you downloaded the source code zip of a project rather than the actual mod zip). Now it warns the user and displays an error
- [Fix] Fixed issue when launcher would crash on startup due to the file system watcher for mod refreshing

W.I.P
- [Added] Abillity to edit/change mod archive priorities
